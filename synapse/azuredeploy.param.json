              to as Corporate Public or NAT IP Ranges. Example CIDR blocks notation is  173.25.163.0/24.
              If you are just trying out provisioning and don't have the exact ranges you can try finding your public IP using the website https://whatismyip.com . Say, if it shows 173.25.66.22 then set the value to 173.25.66.22/32
              At least 1 value is required for the array

          Each element of array is a comma-separted tuple where first tuple is StartIPAddress and second is EndIPAddress.
          Example - If CIDR Range is 173.10.100.0/24 then value is 173.10.100.0,173.10.100.255. 
          You can use the following online tool to get Start and End IP addresses from CIDR block - https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr
